                <h2>Reviews for "Living As If Your Life Depended On It!"</h2>
                <div class="review">
                    <p><strong>Loveetwar:</strong> <span class="stars">★★★★★</span> <strong>"A female warrior shows her
                            path to change and living life directly."</strong> In this book, an experienced therapist
                        who apparently applied what she learned on herself as well as her clients gives her road map to
                        taking responsibility for one's life and creating the life one wants. Cia Ricco gives her path
                        to living your life as if your life depended on it, which of course it does, but few recognize
                        that and few live their lives accordingly. The language is simple and direct and this might lead
                        one to conclude that it is too simple to be effective. That would be a grave mistake. With years
                        of practice as a therapist and in Buddhist meditation, the author gently guides the reader
                        through 12 gateways. How effective they become is totally up to the reader, but there is a
                        powerful tool here for those who work on themselves and wish to live life more directly.</p>

                <div class="review">
                    <p><strong>Wonder:</strong> <span class="stars">★★★★★</span> <strong>"What a simple, yet profound
                            book."</strong> I find myself coming back to it again and again. As I take in its wisdom,
                        deeper and deeper, others around me seem to appreciate it as well. Cia has a way of making what
                        we see as complicated, very simple and straightforward. Her message is real and authentic. I
                        have noticed many shifts in my life because of this book. For that I am grateful.</p>

                <div class="review">
                    <p><strong>Rachel Cohen:</strong> <span class="stars">★★★★★</span> <strong>"One of the best
                            self-help books out there."</strong> It's clear and concise, easy to read. If you integrate
                        what's offered your life will be transformed!</p>
                </div>
                <div class="review">
                    <p><strong>David Mullins:</strong> <span class="stars">★★★★★</span> <strong>"A Small, Often
                            Overlooked Book That Is TRULY Life-Changing."</strong> Cia Ricco's writing in 'Living As If
                        Your Life Depended on It' is direct and cuts through the clutter of psycho-babble of the many
                        degreed therapists, psychiatrists, and psychologists, and combines their valid, but often
                        abstract, observations into instantly practical advice. She believes that repetition of mental
                        and verbal story-telling keep many people in the same rut, and works to go from 'A' to 'B' by
                        the most direct path. This book is VERY special, but not well-publicized as I understand Ms.
                        Ricco has re-located part-time to Costa Rica. I have seen it positively affect readers from a
                        teenager to an elderly 86-year-old woman!</p>

                            YOU!"</strong> Cia Ricco's book is simple and profound at the same time. It has 12 gateways,
                        each of which has the potential to open you up to your full potential. This book may help you
                        shift your beliefs, improve your self-talk and motivate you to take control of your life- after
                        all, your life belongs to YOU! It's time you started living that way.</p>

                            life!"</strong> Cia's work has helped me understand that this life we have is NOT a dress
                        rehearsal...that we only go around once and in this life we are each entitled to our full
                        measure of happiness and abundance. I choose to be present in my life everyday...and I will be
