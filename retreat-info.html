                    <h3>Personal Growth and Empowerment</h3>
                    <p>Is for anyone looking to go deeper in their healing, bring light to shadows, or simply explore
                        what this rapid transformative work can provide. Personal growth may mean healing from trauma,
                        breaking through addiction, depression, anxiety, dealing with chronic pain or fear, wanting new
                        insights on life choices and directions, and wanting a greater sense of connection in their
                        lives.</p>
                    <p>Personal growth may also mean coming for a deeper spiritual understanding of the greater whole
                        and a profound connection with All That Is.</p>

                            was so
                            wonderful to be in her presence--and take in the love and wisdom she shared with me and the
                            group during the retreat.</p>
                        <p>The group provided a great container to delve into deeper layers of my psychological stuff
                            that were standing in the way of fully connecting with myself and the life around me. It was
                            truly inspiring to experience the power of being in a group setting in the expanded states
                            of consciousness with a gifted facilitator like you!</p>

                            grateful for being part of this. <b>I learned so much about myself</b> and took away from it

                    <p class="question">Q: Do I need prior experience with psychedelics to attend?</p>
                    <p class="answer">It’s not necessary to have prior experience at all. You will be in a safe space,
                        supported and guided, and in complete control of what you choose to partake in. You will have
                        the opportunity to meet with Cia by phone before the retreat to ask any questions and discuss
                        what might be right for you.</p>

                    <p class="question">Q: What kind of support is available post-retreat?</p>
                    <p class="answer">We offer post-retreat integration support, including follow-up sessions,
                        resources, and access to a supportive community to help you process your experience.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <p class="question">Q: What types of consciousness-altering substances are offered?</p>
                    <p class="answer">There will be three different medicines available, both heart and mind-opening. If
                        you are new to any of them, you will have a choice of two. You can decide on which two when
                        speaking with Cia. If you are already experienced with two of them, you might be approved for a
                        combination. In some cases, if you have a very high tolerance, you may be given a
                        non-hallucinogenic natural supplement to boost the effect of the conscious-altering substance.
                        For more details please reach out to Cia to discuss by phone.</p>

                    <p class="question">Q: Can I decide later on if I’d like to partake in the psychedelics?</p>
                    <p class="answer">Absolutely. Medicine is always optional. Even if you discuss in advance what you
                        will try and a dose has been prepared for you, you can change your mind and opt-out at any time.

                        will be based on two things: 1. Whether you are coming for training or only for personal growth.
